### Advent Of Code Solutions

This repo contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code Challenge, which can be accessed [here](http://adventofcode.com/).

Comments and pull requests with edits/optimizations are always welcome.

#### Organization

The repo contains one folder for each day's problem.<br>
Each folder will contain an input#.txt file, where # is the problem number.<br>
There will be a separate folder for each part of the problem, containing one solution.java file.
